# CS127 - Intro to Computer Science (Python)

## Overview
This repository contains source code and projects I completed as part of **CS127 - Intro to Computer Science (Python)** at **Hunter College** during the **Fall 2024** semester. The coursework introduced fundamental programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, and an overview of computer science principles. 

## What I Learned
Throughout the semester, I worked on projects that strengthened my ability to:
- Write Python programs using functions, lists, file I/O, loops, and conditionals.
- Develop basic C++ programs in a Linux environment using command-line tools.
- Navigate the Linux file system and understand its structure.
- Work with binary and hexadecimal number systems.
- Explore Boolean logic and simple circuit design.
- Gain a foundational understanding of computer architecture and machine language.
- Get an introduction to advanced topics like artificial intelligence, data science, and networking.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for primary programming assignments)
- **C++** (for basic programming concepts in a Linux environment)
- **Linux CLI** (for file system navigation and command-line tools)
- **Binary & Hexadecimal Systems** (for number representation and logic operations)
- **Machine Language** (for understanding low-level computer operations)

## Notes
This repository reflects my learning experience in CS127. Going through these assignments helped me build a strong foundation in programming, and I found that hands-on practice was essential in understanding the concepts.
